# ðŸ”¬ **Transformer-Based fMRI Analysis for Autism Prediction**   

Iâ€™ve been working on an app that applies a **Transformer-based fMRI encoder model** to predict autism from resting-state fMRI data. The model is trained on datasets like **ABIDE** and integrates **brain connectivity features with demographic data (age, gender)** for classification.  

## **How it works:**  
ðŸ“¡ **Input:** Preprocessed fMRI data (CPAC or similar), age, and gender.  
ðŸ”— **Feature Extraction:** Computes functional connectivity matrices using Nilearn.  
ðŸ§  **Model:** A transformer-based architecture processes the extracted features, leveraging **multi-head attention** and **learned embeddings** for age and gender.  
ðŸ“Š **Output:** A probability score indicating the likelihood of autism, along with a visualization.  

The model was trained with:  
âœ” **BCEWithLogitsLoss** (handling class imbalance)  
âœ” **Ranger optimizer** (RAdam + Lookahead)  
âœ” **Cosine Annealing LR scheduling**  
âœ” **Pooling strategies** (mean, max, attention)
